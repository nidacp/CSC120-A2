What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Python didn't work, so I had to go to TA hours and office hours and then eventually just had to run the code through the terminal. I initially tried to do simple edits to main, but ended up having to make more major changes. The way things were written initially confused me, but once I figured out what everything was trying to do and changed it to object=oriented code it made more sense to me.
